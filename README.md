Welcome to the documentation guide for the Pomodoro Game Timer. 
This is a Game and Application that I wanted to create. 
There are a lot of Pomodoro Timers on the market that helps to focus on productivity. 
However, based on my experience in User Satification and Psychology, i have realized that using games in tandem with Productivity can garner results. 
So I will be creating a Podomoro Timer Game that includes a To Do List as a part of the program.

Red Pallette:
The Red Pallette is for an Active Session 

The closer that the timer get to the end the more that the color should transitition in the next set of colors within the pallette.

Darker Red rgba(229, 56, 71)
Medium Red: rgba(241, 126, 132)
Lighter Red: rgba(236, 172, 177)

The closer that the timer get to the end the more that the color should transitition in the next set of colors within the pallette.
